-- My request --

I am writing a little python program right now to calculate the time left in the queue
of the 2b2t minecraft server. Do do that I devide the time I already spent in the
queue by the places I already moved and then multiply by the places left in the queue.
Somehow I always need way more time then first calculated. How can I fix that?

It's difficult for me to say exactly why your calculation is resulting in an overestimate
of the time left in the queue, as I don't have enough information about your specific
situation or the details of your calculation. However, there are a few potential reasons
why this might be happening.

One possible explanation is that the rate at which you move through the queue is not constant,
and may be affected by a variety of factors such as the number of players currently online,
the rate at which players are joining and leaving the server, and the server's overall
performance. This means that the time it takes to move through the queue can vary, and your
calculation may not accurately reflect these fluctuations.

Another possibility is that your calculation is not taking into account the fact that the
time you spend in the queue is also affected by factors such as lag and server downtime.
If the server is experiencing high latency or periods of downtime, this can cause your
progress through the queue to slow or stop, which would affect the accuracy of your calculation.

To improve the accuracy of your calculation, you may want to consider using a more complex model
that takes into account these and other potential factors that can affect the rate at which you
move through the queue. This could involve using more data points and a more sophisticated
algorithm to make your prediction, which could improve the accuracy of your estimate. Alternatively,
you could try using a different approach to estimating the time left in the queue,
such as collecting data on the average time it takes players to move through the queue
and using that to make your prediction.
